Developed an e-commerce website focusing on gaming and gaming accessories from the 2000s. Users are able to create an account, log in, and search products by name, ID, or product type. 
Items can be added/removed to/from a cart before an order is able to be placed.
Administrators can add or remove items from the catalog, view user account details, manage product stock, view employee details, and authorized placed orders.
Development was done in HTML/CSS and php, with SQL and a MySQL database.
